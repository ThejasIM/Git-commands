//Same as merge but the branch commits are attached on top of latest commit of main branch

// in other branch (feature1)
git rebase main
git checkout main
git rebase  feature1

//We can get the conflict as the merge conflict
// We can choose which one to keep
then,
git add .
git commit -m ""
git rebase --continue	//after all the conflict resolved and we have done new commit

// prefer merge over rebase
//merge helps in history tracking
// use rebase for own self branch and merge for main branch
