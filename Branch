git branch <branch name>    //creates branch
git checkout <branch name>  //switching bwt branches
git branch                  // list of branches
git merge <branch name>     // merging to main branch

git branch -d <name>        // delete branch locally only
    So,     git push origin main
            git push origin --delete <name>
git branch -D <name>        // forcefull delete for not merged branches

// if there is any changes in the main branch while we are dealing with the other branch we call 
// get the chnages from the main branch using pull (We need to be in the other branch only)

git pull origin main
    then,   git checkout main
            git merge <branch name>
